- **Plugin**: VRMInterchange
- **Target**: Unreal Engine 5.6+
- **Specification**: VRM 0.x and VRM 1.0 SpringBone implementations
- **Reference**: UniVRM implementation standards

## Your Task
[INSERT TASK MARKDOWN FILE CONTENT HERE]

## Implementation Requirements

### Code Standards
1. Follow Epic Games' Unreal Engine C++ coding standards
2. Use Unreal's memory management systems (no raw new/delete)
3. Employ UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION macros appropriately
4. Maintain thread safety where applicable
5. Use FMath functions for mathematical operations
6. Prefer TArray over std::vector, FString over std::string

### VRM Compliance Requirements
1. Exactly match the mathematical algorithms from the VRM specification
2. Properly convert between glTF coordinate system (Y-up, right-handed) and Unreal (Z-up, left-handed)
3. Maintain compatibility with both VRM 0.x and VRM 1.0 formats
4. Ensure behavior consistency with UniVRM reference implementation

### Performance Considerations
1. Minimize per-frame allocations
2. Use cache-friendly data structures
3. Implement SIMD optimizations where beneficial
4. Consider parallel processing for independent operations
5. Profile changes to ensure no performance regression

### Testing Requirements
1. Test with at least 3 different VRM models (provided in test_assets/)
2. Verify no visual artifacts or animation glitches
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing assets
4. Validate memory usage and performance metrics
5. Test edge cases (zero bones, many colliders, etc.)

### Documentation Requirements
1. Add comprehensive comments for complex algorithms
2. Document any deviations from the specification with reasoning
3. Update function headers with parameter descriptions

### Step 4: Documentation
- Complete the post-mortem template
- Document any challenges encountered
- Note any remaining issues
- Provide rollback instructions

## Deliverables
1. Modified source code files

3. Test results and performance metrics
4. Any new unit tests created
5. Updated documentation

## Constraints and Warnings
- DO NOT modify the public API without explicit approval

- DO NOT ignore thread safety in animation code
- DO NOT skip coordinate system conversions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
